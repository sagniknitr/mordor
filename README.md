# Purpose

This is pure C-Model code for various linear algebra and computer vision kernels used in a typical adas systems.Currently targeting vision based sensor, but may move to 
other interesting stuff like radar, GPS, etc..

Features:

1. Very basic and easy to read implementation without any aggresive optimizations.

2. Most of the modules are widely used in libraries like opencv.

3. Minimum dependency.
